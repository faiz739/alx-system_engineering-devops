Issue Summary:
On May 5th, 2023, from 2:30 pm to 5:00 pm EST, users were experiencing intermittent errors and slow responses while accessing our e-commerce website. Approximately 40% of users were affected, leading to a loss of revenue of $50,000. The root cause of the issue was a database overload.

Timeline:

2:30 pm: The issue was detected when our monitoring system sent an alert indicating high CPU usage on the database server.
2:35 pm: The database administrator checked the database logs and noticed a spike in queries.
2:40 pm: The web development team was informed, and they started investigating the website's code for potential inefficiencies.
3:00 pm: The investigation led the team to believe that the issue was caused by a misconfigured query in the code.
3:30 pm: The team deployed a patch to fix the query and restarted the web servers.
4:00 pm: The issue persisted despite the patch, leading the team to realize that it was caused by an overload on the database.
4:15 pm: The team started optimizing the database queries to reduce the load.
4:45 pm: The issue was resolved, and the website returned to normal operation.
Root Cause and Resolution:
The root cause of the issue was a database overload caused by a surge in user activity. The surge in activity led to an increase in the number of queries, which overloaded the database server. To fix the issue, the team optimized the database queries and added more resources to the server.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:
To prevent similar issues from happening in the future, the team will:

Implement a load balancer to distribute the load across multiple database servers.
Add more resources to the database servers to handle higher loads.
Set up automatic scaling rules to increase resources during peak traffic.
Improve the website's code by optimizing queries and reducing the number of requests to the database.
Monitor the database server more closely to detect potential issues before they cause downtime.
TODO:

Implement a load balancer.
Add more resources to the database servers.
Set up automatic scaling rules.
Optimize queries and reduce the number of requests to the database.
Improve database monitoring.
